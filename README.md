# Computational_Algebra

Repository focused on the implementation of efficient algorithms for algebraic structures and number theory. 
It features arithmetic in finite fields, fast polynomial multiplication using Karatsuba and FFT/IFFT, and advanced division/inversion via Toeplitz matrices. 
Additionally, it includes robust factorization engines using Cantor-Zassenhaus and square-free decomposition. 

This collection is part of the Computational Algebra course in the Mathematics degree at Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM).
